# liviutudor.co is going to become my personal website.
I would like to display on it the projects that I've build and the ones that I am currently working on.
I would like to incorporate a blog too... where I should write ( even if I am not a good writer and english is not my native language) blog-posts about my journey into web-development !!!
I am curently design-in and re-designing the website... so it is still in progress..
